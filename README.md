2d side scrolling flight game.
'simple' controls (joystick/touch point to fly up/down/left/right)
some sort of stall mechanism (fly up too far, plane slows/falls down. lose control for a second)
shooting things maybe, would rather be non-violent. collect things in the air, deliver them to different areas.
